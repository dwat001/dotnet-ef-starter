# dotnet-ef-starter
A walk through of starting a simple EF MVC.NetCore Application aimed at learning coders

#First Some Prerequiests
We are going to need .Net Core, I will be using version 6.0, any version latter then that should work. This is downloadable from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download 

We are going to need something to edit files I would suggest Visual Studio Code a free editor from Microsoft.

We are going to be using a command line interface, Visual Studio Code as one built in sitting right in there for you.
